Currently, I am working with Dr. T to create stronger surveys that adjust the standard Likert-scale multiple choice surveys to improve the data quality of survey responses while decreasing the subjective cognitive load of the respondents. Next, we are looking to examine free-response questions and their purpose in educational and groupwork related surveys. In this genre of projects, our goal is to improve the survey experience for both the surveyors and the respondents so that you don’t have to feel bored the next time you take a survey.\nIn my free time, you can catch me playing intramural sports, rock climbing, and listening to music too loud.\n\n\n\n Interests\n\nR & Python\nSurvey Design\nText Analysis\n\n\n\n\n Education\nCal Poly\nB.S. in Statistics & Minor in Data Science, 2027"

    "text": "Lab Values\n\nCompassion\nIn this group, we care about each other, not just in our work lives, but also as individuals that have lives outside of this work. We encourage our collaborators to prioritize their personal health and well-being before our research, and we respect each other’s personal boundaries. We strive to embody kindness in all of our interactions with each other, and attempt to show up for each other in moments of distress. We honor each other’s identities and backgrounds.\n\n\nCommunity\nIn this group, we strive to foster a supportive research environment. We show respect for each other’s time by setting clear expectations on project timelines, roles, progress, and issues. We assess progress towards goals often, adjust our expectations when necessary, and offer flexibility/wiggle room when unexpected circumstances come up. We make an effort to coordinate our work with an understanding that we all have unique work styles. We consistently keep lines of communication open, especially when things are not going as planned or when conflicts arise. We work to develop trust in each other by following through on commitments and showing respect for each other’s ideas - both in moments when we are in agreement and in moments when we are offering critique. We offer mentorship in cases when we have specialized knowledge to share, and we acknowledge the unique knowledge that everyone in the group brings to the collaboration. We celebrate each other’s successes and hype each other up in moments when we feel discouraged. We strive for consensus in our decision-making and understand that this, at times, requires compromise.\n\n\nGrit\nIn this group, we work hard toward our goals. We are proactive problem-solvers, taking initiative in order to persevere as challenges arise. We set the intention to follow through on our commitments. We recognize the significance of diverse kinds of labor - from the most tedious and monotonous to the most innovative and creative.\n\n\nPurpose\nIn this group, we work towards a collective vision of advancing social and environmental equity, justice, and accountability through improvements to data infrastructure. We are transparent about the social and political aims of our work to newcomers and in public presentations of the work. We seek out opportunities to advocate on behalf of interventions that align with our collective vision. We prioritize our collective vision when making decisions about who will be invited to participate in the work, which groups we will seek input from, what resources we will accept/leverage to support the work, and through what channels the work will be disseminated.\n\n\nIntegrity\nIn this group, we are committed to presenting our work with honesty and context. We value reflexivity in our research practice. We acknowledge what we don’t know, can’t know (due to our unique positionality), or have yet to learn. We listen carefully, especially to perspectives held by those with cultural identities we do not share, and are willing to have assumptions challenged. We admit mistakes, learn from them, and then move on from them."

    "text": "Roles and Responsibilities\n\nJoining the Lab\nWe are thrilled to invite new members to the lab. When joining the lab, you should do the following:\n\nRead this lab book.\nEmail Lindsay or the Lead Mentor and ask to be added to our Slack Workspace. Check out this tutorial if you are new to Slack.\nJoin the #onboarding Slack channel, and follow the instructions in Lindsay’s October 4, 2021 post.\nJoin Slack channels related to the projects you will be working on and read recent correspondence in these channels. Configure your Slack notifications in these channels.\nCreate a GitHub account, and send Lindsay your GitHub handle.\nCreate a Zotero account here and install both Zotero and Zotero Connector here here. Send Lindsay or the Lead Mentor your Zotero username so they can add you to our shared Zotero account. Then watch this video, introducing Zotero.\nAsk Lindsay to be added to the shared Google Drive. See if you can find your work folder for this semester.\n\nComplete CITI Training here (Navigate to Required Online Ethics Training and follow instructions). You should complete the Basic Human Subjects - Social and Behavioral Course. Send me a copy of your certificate upon completion.\nSend Lindsay a headshot and short biography so that you can be added to the Lab website.\n\n\n\nFaculty Responsibilities\n\nThis section draws heavily from the Carceral Ecologies Lab Book and the Aly Lab Manual\n\nAs the director of the Data Ethnography and Advocacy Lab, Lindsay commits to:\n\nSupport you (academically, intellectually, emotionally, financially)\nProvide timely feedback on project ideas, data analysis, writing, and presentations\nReview and approve timesheets on a timely basis\nBe regularly available in person and via email to discuss both lab-related research and other research interests\nSupport your career development (e.g. helping you network with people in the field, introducing you to infrastructures and workflows that may be relevant to your future career, writing recommendation letters, and inviting you to attend conferences when finances permit)\nEnsuring that you are acknowledged for your contributions in all presentations of our work\nEncourage you to prioritize your physical and emotional well-being before other obligations\n\n\n\nStudent Researcher Responsibilities\n\nThis section draws heavily from the Carceral Ecologies Lab Book and the CLEAR Lab Book.\n\nAs a student researcher, you will be expected to:\n\nTake care of your physical and mental well-being first. If you are sick or burnt out, please stay home. If possible, let us know ahead of time that you need to step back. The Schacht Center has a number of resources available to help navigate distressing times.\nAttend weekly lab meetings. Lab meetings are held weekly for one-hour. In these meetings, we discuss how we operate as a lab and as a community, along with our progress on a number of projects. Please let us know ahead of time if you cannot make a meeting via the #general channel on Slack - preferably at least 24 hours in advance (though we recognize this is not always possible). You do not need to explain why you cannot attend a meeting in this message, but please don’t create a habit of missing meetings.\nTake personal initiative with group support. While we collaborate as a team, each individual member of our group has a personal responsibility to ensure that their contributions to the work get done. There will not be a great deal of oversight of your work, so we expect that each member will take steps to manage their time effectively, honestly communicate their capacity to contribute, and let us know if/when they need to re-evaluate their time commitments. To help cultivate and sustain this culture of accountability, all group members are encouraged to support each other by outlining manageable tasks, helping out with tasks in times of struggle (when asked), and respecting a group member’s decision to step back when needed.\nProblem solve when you can. Ask questions when you are unsure. We are all here to help each other navigate this work, and we encourage you to ask questions and request help when it’s needed. Still, attempting to problem solve when you can demonstrates that you value your collaborator’s time, so try that first. If you learn how to do something that might be helpful to others, share it in our Slack Workspace!\nContribute to a caring and collaborative environment. Celebrate each other’s successes, respect each other’s individual strengths and weaknesses, demonstrate compassion for each other’s struggles, and affirm each other’s diverse identities.\nMistakes happen. Admit mistakes, and then move on.\n\n\n\nAssignment of Roles\nRoles get assigned to members of the lab that have already been with us for a full semester. After your first semester as a lab member, you will be expected to take on at least one role per semester. Roles will be assigned during the previous semester’s last lab meeting and will be rotated every semester. Roles will be determined on a volunteer basis and confirmed via group consensus.\nNote-taking will be a shared rotating responsibility. We will maintain a spreadsheet listing who is responsible for note-taking in the Google Drive.\n\nLab Manager\n\nSchedules meetings and sends out meeting reminders\nTakes attendance at all meetings\nPoint person for attendance\nArchives zoom recordings\nManages assets\nManages Kanban\n\n\n\nDocumentation Manager\n\nResponsible for keeping Google Drive organized\nResponsible for ensuring that each GitHub repo meets requirements outlined in the Documentation Guidelines\nMaintains to-do lists on our documentation\n\n\n\nWeb Manager\n\nResponsible for keeping the website up-to-date\nMaintains a blog publishing schedule,\nCollects and edits blog posts from collaborative teams,\nCollaborates with social media manager\n\n\n\nSocial Media Manager\n\nResponsible for finding relevant organizations to network with and follow\nResponsible for posting news stories and videos relevant to our work\nResponsible for advertising blog posts on social media\n\n\n\nLead Mentor\n\nPoint person for new members\nChecks in with new members regularly\nAnswers or directs questions in the #newbies Slack channel\n\n\n\nEvent Manager\n\nMaintains lab calendar\nMain point of contact for guest speakers (managing scheduling, setting up meeting times etc)\nPlans end of semester social event\nMaintains list of lab birthdays and sends birthday cards from the lab\n\n\n\n\nExiting the Lab\nWe understand and respect that you may need to step away from your position in the lab to prioritize attention elsewhere. As advocates for your success, we also celebrate when new opportunities arise! If you need to step away from your position, you should reach out to Lindsay as soon as possible. We will set up a meeting to discuss how you should document the state of your work and to complete a short exit interview."

When posting message, please be sure to post in the relevant channel:\n\n#general: announcements to all group members\n#[project-name]: communication regarding a particular DEAL project\n#support: questions about the group protocols, timesheet reporting, or other group infrastructures\n#cheers: celebrate lab member accomplishments or express gratitude for a lab member’s work\n#random: non-work related conversations\n\nSince Slack is our primary means of communication, you should check Slack regularly. You may wish to install the Slack Desktop application to help keep track of Slack messages. You can also configure Slack to notify you when messages come through on specific channels. You are not expected to respond to Slack messages on evenings and weekends.\n\n\nGitHub\nWhen you join the lab, you will be added to our GitHub organization. There are series of repository templates available for creating new GitHub repositories. We’ve created these templates to ensure consistency across our folder structures and completeness in the contents of our README documents.
