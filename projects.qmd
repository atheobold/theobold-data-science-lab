#### Equitable Pair Programming

::: small
We are studying how instructors can create pair programming environments that
support *every* student.

#### Groupworthy Data Science Activities

::: small
We are creating a set of data science activities that are cognitively engaging
and require multiple, diverse perspectives to complete. These activities can be
integrated alongside pair programming!

#### Increasing Cognitive Engagement in Surveys

::: small
This project is led by Otis Hunt, who is interested in exploring what survey
options / structure is associated with students engaging more in the surveys
their instructors provide. Otis was awarded the [2025 Frost Research Scholarship](https://cosam.calpoly.edu/prospective-students/frost-fund/frost-scholarship)
to continue this research.

#### Introduction to R

::: small
We are developing a "baby R" curriculum which introduces students to R during 
their first quarter at Cal Poly. The course has no computing pre-requisite.

#### Data science trajectory

::: small
We are interested in the pathways students take when learning data science 
concepts and skills---how do concepts build on each other? What are the
key stumbling blocks?

#### Students' Self Perceptions

::: small
This project was led by Jett Palmer, who was interested in exploring how an 
instructor's pedagogical methods were associated with aspects of studentsâ€™
social identities (e.g., disciplinary identity). Jett presented on this 
research during the [2023 eCOTS Poster Presentations](Student Collaborative Experiences & Self-Perceptsions -- A Comparison Study of Complex Instruction).
