#### Students' Self Perceptions

::: small
This project was led by Jett Palmer, who was interested in exploring how an 
instructor's pedagogical methods were associated with aspects of studentsâ€™
social identities (e.g., disciplinary identity). Jett presented on this 
research during the [2023 eCOTS Poster Presentations](Student Collaborative Experiences & Self-Perceptsions -- A Comparison Study of Complex Instruction).
