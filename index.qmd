Welcome to Dr. T's (Theobold) research lab! Our research lab is comprised of
undergraduate and master's student researchers from the Department of Statistics
at Cal Poly. Our research group is interested in researching students' classroom
experiences and how these experiences affect various aspects of their affect
toward statistics and data science. 

Interested in what we're currently working on? Check out our current [projects](projects.qmd). Are you a current or prospective student at Cal 
Poly? Consider [joining us](join-us.qmd)!
