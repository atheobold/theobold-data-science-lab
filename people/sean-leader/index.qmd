Hello! I'm Sean, originally from Tucson, Arizona but I moved to San Luis Obispo
for college to study Statistics and Data Science at Cal Poly. During my time
there, I researched introductory statistics curriculum and student
collaborations (thanks to Dr. Theobold!). I am currently pursuing my PhD in
Statistics at UC Irvine, where I'm working to derive a new statistical
methodology for biomarker research in the area of Alzheimer's disease. I hope to
one day teach at a university where I can spread the joy of statistics with
future generations of students.
