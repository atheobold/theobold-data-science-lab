Hello! I'm originally from San Diego, and I'm currently studying Statistics at
Cal Poly. My research focuses on how institutional and pedagogical factors
influence human behavior. I enjoy exploring statistics in applied contexts and
staying involved in campus governance. Outside of the classroom, I play
pickleball and indulge my passion for craft coffee!
