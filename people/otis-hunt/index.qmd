I'm Otis from Marin County, CA, and I'm studying Statistics while working 
towards the Data Science minor. Currently, I am working with Dr. T to create
stronger surveys that adjust the standard Likert-scale multiple choice surveys
to improve the data quality of survey responses while decreasing the subjective cognitive load of the respondents. Next, we are looking to  examine
free-response questions and their purpose in educational and groupwork related
surveys. In this genre of projects, our goal is to improve the survey experience
for both the surveyors and the respondents so that you don't have to feel bored
the next time you take a survey. 

In my free time, you can catch me playing intramural sports, rock climbing, and
listening to music too loud.
